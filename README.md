This is one of the projects in which I practiced my Go skills.

I recently discovered how fast and neat the Go language is, so decided to give it a go and fell in love immediately.

Once I get more experienced with this beast, I'll move most of my high-demand APIs (created with Next.js route handlers) to Go ones.
